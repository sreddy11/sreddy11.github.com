Today marked another milestone in my Viget internship: I did some client work!

Zach was kind enough do let me pairing with him on a project that shall not be named (but there is a special name 
for it around the office). It was pretty simple, just setting up some models, but it was a cool experience. I got 
to see how Zach think things ahead in making programming decisions. There should be some more good experiences to 
come.

In other news, I have made decent project on my group project. I essentially have the basic functionality done, but
that is just the easy part. Adding the "flare" to the app will be the hardest part. It will require using some 
things I never have before (i.e. websockets). Plus, integrating with the front-end may prove to be difficult. But 
gotta stay positive and keep plugging away.

Intern out.
