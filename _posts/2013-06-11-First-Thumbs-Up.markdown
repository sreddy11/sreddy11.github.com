Today I made some headway in hackernews, getting through some of the 
feature Brian outlined in Basecamp. Chris walked me through how to do a pull
request and I got some great feedback from some developers, a lot of them 
being about conventions of working with rails, and ways to shorten code
and make it more efficient

Progess was also made with the group intern project. Curt stemmed an idea 
that we were all very receptive to (to be revealed later) and we feel as 
if we have something we can run with.

It's game time. Intern out.
