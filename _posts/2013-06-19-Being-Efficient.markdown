title:  Being More Efficient

I have a bad habit when I do programming: When I see that I have something that works, I just run with it. I tend not to stop and ask myself
"Can it be done more efficiently?" However, in my time here interning at Viget so far, this is by far this biggest thing I am beginning to
improve upon, pretty much do to code reviews.

Code reviews are something that are very new for me. In all my classes, my assignments just get looked at by one or two people who just but 
a grade on it but don't give much feedback otherwise. Having the experieced devs review all my code has helped me look at things I would not
have otherwise. Although the nitpicky nature of it may be frustrating sometimes, I definitely understand the purpose and am learning a lot 
from it.

Intern out.
