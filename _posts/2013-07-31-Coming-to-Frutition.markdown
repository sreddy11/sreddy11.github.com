Today marks a great day in Viget history (and American history in general)

We have a woking product!

Thanks to a lot of hard work by everyone, we now have a working demo of 2 player Rock,Paper,Scissors that works 
with AJAX requests instead of forms and which the game takes place in a single page.

Plus it looks awesome! Get ready to see it on Friday, fellow Vigets!

Intern out
