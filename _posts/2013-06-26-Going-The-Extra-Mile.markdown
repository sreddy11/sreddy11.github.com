Today, I finished up all the stories for the HackerNews replica. So naturally, I decided to do what is instilled in all asian kids by their parents at birth: do the extra credit. In this case, there is not acutally "extra credit", 
but there were some bonus features that I thought would be cool to try out.

First, karma points. Before I actually wrote any code, I thought this was really complicated to work out. But it 
turns out karma points is simply "upvotes - downvotes". I'm suprised no more thought was put into that, but it made
it every easy for me to implement.

Now the real challenge: emailing a lost password. I wasn't sure how to start, but Chris gave me some direction in 
creating a "password reset token". After that it was pretty easy, just attach the token to the link and send the 
link in the fake e-mail. 

That's a wrap on the day for me.

Intern out.
