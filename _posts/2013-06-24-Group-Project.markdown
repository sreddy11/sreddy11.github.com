Today I started doing some work for the group project. I have definitely been behind my teammates in how much how I have put into it (they 
have been doing excellent work), but I feel like I caught up today. I created basically gameplay for RPS, essentially two player playing on
the same screen. This helped me walk through the layout of how a game would work, essentially creating a rounds controller that does one 
"throw" and have that nested inside a matches controller.

Next step is to work with Curt on figuring out the control flow of the app as well as working with Jing in figuring out how to bring our two
end together. I'm excited.

Intern out.
