Today I learned a very valuable lesson: Do not get too far ahead of your pull requests. It will bite you back eventually.

I essentially spent the whole day not doing any code, but just refactoring all my files via git. My branches were all over the place, since
I was jumping around from branch to branch. This was making it so when I would fix something in one branch it would just show up in the 
other branch. Thus, I spent the whole day rebasing my branches and doing cherrypicks so that the branches were more linear. It was a great 
lesson, but kind of a waste of a day. At least I will never do it again.

Intern out.
