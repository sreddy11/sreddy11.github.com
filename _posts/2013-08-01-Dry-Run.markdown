Sadly, today I did not get to do much coding. Today mostly consisited of minor touch-ups to the group project and 
preparing a presentation to demo the app tommorow during LabShare. We nailed down the timing of the project and it 
looks really good. Very excited for tomorrow!

On the individual porject front, I would say I have been falling behind a bit due to shifting focus to the group 
project. However, I am sure I can have something good to demo on Wednesday, so get read devs.

Intern out.
