Today, we hit another milestone with the group project. The base functionality is now complete on the back-end. 
Two users can play a match against each other and it works fully and is able to display statistics about the page.

However, right now its just working through forms, so we will have to fix it so that updates occur on the fly
without refreshing. It will require some close work with Jing, the FED intern. Looking forward to it.

Intern out.
