I have finished my first week at Viget, and it has been a great learning
experience, plus the people are great. I have finished doing a small rails 
project form scratch, creaing post and comment functionality with a blog,
and getting used to test-driven development.

In light of finishing my first week as an intern, I thought I would go see 
that movie "The Internship" where Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson intern at 
Google.

Have a good weekend everyone.
