This week, I am getting started on the hacker news project, which seems like
a doozy. Chris talked me through how to best approach the project, thinking
of each feature of the app as a story and implementing these features one a
time to build it up. To help with that, Chris also showed me to how work 
with github branches and other github features to help track different 
feature

Today also marked the first brainstorming session for the intern project.
Ben and Oliver went through some exercises with us to get the creative 
juices flowing. Hopefully it will yield some results going foward.

That's all for today. Intern out
