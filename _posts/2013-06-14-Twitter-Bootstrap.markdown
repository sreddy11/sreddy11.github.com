Today, since I completed the functionality for the stuff for week one and am waiting on pull requests, I began using
Twitter bootstrap to improve the appearance of the project. Twitter bootstrap has been very easy to use, essentially
transforming your HTML into something nice-looking without you doing much. Using twitter bootstrap, I was able to
add a banner menu, as well as tabs between articles and submissions. See below.

This weekend, I hope to be able to explore Durham a bit more, and perhaps check out that music festival that is 
going on downtown.

Intern out.
