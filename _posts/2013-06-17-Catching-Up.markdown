As of today, the work that I have had reviewed is quite far behind the work I accomplished. Thus, Chris suggested 
not moving forward until I get caught up on my pull requests from week one and merge everything in with the master.
Thus, I have been messing around more with Twitter bootstrap while taking in all the feedback that is coming in from
the pull requests. 

As for the group project, we met with Ben and Oliver to go over a general timeline. They has now assigned us to 
an minimal product by next week to get us going. For me, I will properly code in the logic for a round of two people
playing RPS.

Also, I have started to read over the backbone materials in accordance with Pat's lecture this afternoon. It seems
like it will be a really cool learning experience. Hopefully I will be able to squeeze in enough time to complete 
the exercise.


Intern out.
