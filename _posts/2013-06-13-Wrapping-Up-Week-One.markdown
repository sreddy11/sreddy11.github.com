Today, I was able to finish up the functionality for everything that was on tap for week one with Hacker News. 
However, I am still running behind on doing pull requests on features, which I have been getting fantastic feedback 
through those, helping me to learn a lot. Along with the feedback, Chris has been showing me some cool ways to make the code better (i.e. helper methods). He also suggested using twitter bootstrap to make the appearance look better,
so hopefully I'll be able to squeeze some time for that.

Intern out.
