title: Getting My Hands Dirty
---

Today I really dived into learning some rails, creating the post and comment
functionality from a blog. I have been learning a lot and Chris has been 
super helpful in answering all my questions and spending a lot of time with
me teaching me the basics.

The functionality for posting and commenting is 95% done. After I finish, I
will probably take a look into the hacker news app and brainstorming project
ideas.

Time to watch the Heat-Spurs

Intern out.
