<p>This is my first official post in my Viget blog for the summer. Everything is going really well; the office environment is far different from my expectations from watching &#8220;The Office&#8221; on NBC. I am still looking to challenge theoffice ping-pong champ.</p>

<p>So far, Chris has helped me immensely in getting the software setup on my latop, and now I have just been working on setting up this blog. It&#8217;s pretty plain so far, will get more done by today.</p>
