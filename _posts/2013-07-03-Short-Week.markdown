Happy fourth!

This week is a shortened work week and I will be heading to Myrtle Beach for the weekend! Although I won't be 
coding for a while, I feel in a good place with the progress I have made. The base functionality for the RPS group
project is nearly complete and I have the stories for my individual project all planned out. Good things to come!

Intern out.
