Today was my second day at Viget; still getting oriented with everything but
I am loving it so far. I can't wait to start collaborating with the interns
both on the group project and on winning the summer scramble.

As far as work I have been doing, today Chris helped me out learning rails,
learning the MVC concept and the control flow of the framework. We went 
through Test-driven devlopment by creating a simple blog from scratch, 
and will do more of the same tomorrow

Intern out.
