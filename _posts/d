Today, I started working on the Hacker News prject. Chris gave me some good
advice on how to approach the project, working on one feature/story at
a time and slowly building up the project.To help do that, Chris also walke
me through using git to create different branches for working with different
features. 

Today also marked the first brainstorming session for the group intern
project. Ben and Oliver helped us do some exercises to get the creative 
flowing. Hopefully it yields some results

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
