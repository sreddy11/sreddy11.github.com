Today the Durham intern team revealed to the word CrushCoverCut, an online Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

The demo ran very smoothly and we got a lot of love from our fellow Vigets! The other groups did a great job as 
well, and I would reccommend using their apps: Proofessor and BattleOfTheHands ASAP.

I enjoyed working on this so much with the fellow interns. I learned so much working with them and working at Viget
this summer. This experience will stay with me forever. Sadly, there's just one week left, but all good things
must come to an end.

Intern Out.
