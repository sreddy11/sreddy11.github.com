I am feeling pretty good about my progess here so far with the Hacker News project. I got the functionality done for everything on tap for
week two. This, however, is by no means perfect. I am getting a lot of feedback from the pull requests and figuring how to make my code most
efficient, something Chris has been particularly helpful in working with me.

But more importantly, tonight is Game 7. Enough said.

Intern out.
