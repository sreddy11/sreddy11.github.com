Made some great progress with Hacker News. Got the thumbs up from the devs 
on two features, as well as completing the functionality for everything 
listed for week one. I have been getting tons of feedback and have 
been learning a lot. Tomorrow, I will run through it and see how to make it
more robust and efficient. Chris showed me some cool stuff with helper 
functions to help do so.

Our intern group also pitched our idea to those in the office, who gave us
some great feedback as to what might be feasible. Chris also made a good
note to encourage to focus on what we can learn from it as opposed to 
worrying about whether it may be redundant to other ideas.

After deliberating after the meeting, our group hashed out some more ideas 
and we feel that we are on the same page.
