Today marked another milestone in my Viget internship: I did some client work!

Zach was kind enough do let me pairing with him on a project. Today we worked on setting up a tumblr API for the 
application. It allowed me to see some cool gems such as CarrierWave for handling images and VCR for speeding up 
rspec tests. 

On the project front, the integration of the app with the front-end is coming together. The welcome screen was 
simple since that just used a form, so I just had to change the form attributes to match the css attributes. 
Overall, I'm very happy with the progress being made.

Intern out.
